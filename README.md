# DFT
An implementation of the conventional Discrete Fourier Transform algorithm in C.

Can be compiled into a shared object file by running `make`, or it can be integrated into a larger project directly. The conventional DFT is an $O(n^2)$ algorithm and is not optimal for conventional use, this project exists for benchmark comparisons.
